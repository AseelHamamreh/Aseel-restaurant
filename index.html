        <p>
            Seafood is a high-protein food that is low in calories, total fat, and saturated fat. High in vitamins and
            minerals, seafood has been shown to have numerous health benefits. For example, recent studies have shown
            that eating seafood can decrease the risk of heart attack, stroke, obesity, and hypertension. Seafood also
            provides essential nutrients for developing infants and children.
        </p>


        <h2 class="headers"> Calories and Protein </h2>
        <p>
            Seafood is generally considered to be a low-calorie protein source. Most low-fat species of fish, such as
            cod, flounder and sole, contain less than 100 calories per 3-ounce cooked portion, and even fattier fish
            like mackerel, herring, and salmon have about 200 calories per serving. Seafood is a complete protein
            source. It contains enough of the essential amino acids to assure healthy growth and optimal fetal
            development. A 3-ounce serving of most fish and shellfish provides about about 30-40% of the average daily
            recommended amount of protein. The protein in seafood is easier to digest because seafood has less
            connective tissue than red meats and poultry.
            <br>

            <h2 class="headers"> Fat and Cholesterol </h2>
            Seafood is generally considered to be low in total fat and saturated fat. Most fish and shellfish contain
            less than 5 percent total fat, and even the fattiest fish, such as mackerel and king salmon, have no more
            than 15 percent fat. A large proportion of the fat in seafood is polyunsaturated, including omega-3 fatty
            acids, which have added health benefits.

            Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are required for healthy human development. These organic
            compounds cannot be produced by the human body and therefore need to be obtained through food. Scientific
            evidence suggests that the marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
            docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can help reduce the risk of heart disease and contribute to brain and vision
            development in infants. Fish and shellfish are the main dietary sources of EPA and DHA. The plant-derived
            omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is a precursor to EPA and DHA and is only converted at rates
            of about 0.1-9% in the human body. The American Heart Association recommends 1000 milligrams (mg) of EPA/DHA
            per day for patients with coronary heart disease, and two meals of oily fish per week for patients without
            heart disease. Fish with medium to high levels of omega-3 fatty acids include oily ocean fish, such as
            salmon, herring, mackerel and sardines (see Description of Omega-3’s and Their Role in Human Health).

            Cholesterol is present at varying amounts in most animal foods. Current dietary recommendations suggest
            limiting cholesterol intake to 300 mg per day. Almost all fish and shellfish contain well under 100 mg of
            cholesterol per 3-ounce cooked serving, and many of the leaner types of fish have less than 60 mg.
